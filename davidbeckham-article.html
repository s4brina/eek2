               <p id="article-font">"Arrival at the David Beckham International Airport, Purgatorio for trans-hemispheric flights. I knew the lightning storm that delayed take-off would make my transfer difficult, but I didn’t expect to be told not long beyond disembarking that the connection had already left and that the next one on offer was not for four thousand hours and twenty-five minutes. I accepted the situation. This airport was designed by the military for leisure and was surely suited to stays of intensities such as mine.<br><br>
                Routine security blood analysis and AI e-meter reading goes smoothly. Signs direct us from ‘FOUCAULDIAN BIO-TYRANNY – (Arabic Translation) – (Mandarin Translation)’ to ‘BAUDRILLARIAN PLEASURE GULAG – (Arabic Translation) – (Mandarin Translation)’, and I do feel relaxed by this transition despite having not showered in recent memory beyond the ‘randomly administered’ (but obviously biased) full-body pesticide spray I endured as I entered the Inferno stage of this journey (I’m travelling from Australia to rural France to see a vintage iPod perform for thirty seven minutes at a music festival organised by François Hollande).
                Despite some people claiming the DBIA (David_Beckham_International_Airport) as one of the most advanced in the world it was in fact largely inspired by the 2002 film Attack of the Clones which is now seventy years old. This does feel like a city in outer space. A David Beckham hologram approaches me to task if I needed any help getting wherever I’m going. I tell him how long my flight’s delayed for and ask for a best course of action. David Beckham replies that there are two primary options for the lengthier of airport stays, a) a choice of from up to nine hundred grades of hotel accommodation or b) experimental cryopreservation as a part of a Taliban-sponsored reality tv pilot. I’m given directions for one of the general hotel concierges.<br><br>
                A twenty-minute walk and two-hour train journey lands me with the general hotel concierge. After a two hour and twenty-minute credit check I’m approved for ranks one through to three and a half of the nine hundred hotel options. I splurge and go for level three and a half, which the hotel concierge (a David Beckham hologram) tells me is wise as levels three and below in fact double as migrant detention centers, one simply pays for a more cosmopolitan lunch menu. I’m also advised that three percent of all purchases in this airport go directly to a Timothée Chalamet-fronted charity fighting for the global illegalisation of trade unions (especially in third world countries). This David Beckham, like the last, also suggests that I spend plenty of time in the airport’s famous central forest – a real forest that looks fake, not vice versa, the first of its kind. I have indeed been recommended this forest many times. I’ve seen many photos of it on the social media pop-ups that subsidise my sleep medication via nightmare-advertising. I will spend time in this forest and eat a Gordon Ramsey hamburger for 600 USD.<br><br>
                The good thing about staying so low down the hotel’s levels is that the lift journey will be quick. This is what I thought at least, before entering the lift and realising that this reverse-privilege must have been realised during the design process; the levels are reversed, and so it is we of the lower levels who spend more than an hour rising to our levels of purchase. About halfway through the journey another low leveller tells me that we’re actually travelling downwards, not upwards; this central airport hotel was renovated out of a nuclear Armageddon bunker slash militia training center built by an eccentric Oligarch from the Wittgenstein family who was obsessed with the 2003 science fiction film The Core. When I ask this person why it feels as though we’re moving upwards, he says that the experience we’re currently enduring is an effect of a Psychological Operation administered hallucenogenically via the lift’s mild fragrance and Taylor Swift bot muzak, which together create an extremely believable sensation of rising when we are in fact falling. I ask this person, who is an unaccompanied six-year-old boy wearing a The Core (2003) branded t-shirt, what purpose any military would have in reversing one’s experience of downwards vs. upwards, to which he replies that if it’s possible for military scientists to reverse this experience in our minds, then there’s no telling what other experience they may invert. This child exits the lift at level ninety-six. I continue forth on my own.
                Level three and a half is better than I expected. It feels like a normal hotel lobby. Not a great one, but one. A non-holographic person in butler-ish attire welcomes me in and tells me nothing. The area is self-explanatory I suppose. A sea of dark brown leather lounge furniture with a smorgasbord at one end and bathrooms well-signposted. The furniture is mostly curved, many pieces allow you to lean back in attempt to sleep though it seems the prevention of sleep is still a design objective; mangled bodies try but just worm back and forth between stress positions. All is lurid as around the furniture clusters are also lamps, almost as tall as those of the street, their brightness is absurd. In fact, I think I watched a documentary about Abu Ghraib on YouTube which claimed the use of similar fittings for sleep deprivation torture across multiple Iraq War prisons. A twenty-minute exercise in climbing up one such lamp like a spider monkey lets me inspect the light fitting to then determine via Google that my hunch cannot be verified.
                To the smorgasbord. Also, better than I expected. The presence of both breakfast and indeterminate lunch and/or dinner food suggests that the lights never go off here, which is of no surprise. As I load a plate with multiple pastas a fifty-odd year old in a purple shirt asks me how long I’m ‘stranded’ here for, to which I reply, “somewhere near four thousand hours”. He doesn’t tell me how long he’s here for but offers me “the major hack” or rather warning for this hotel level: the bathroom attendants are understaffed and so for several hours each day their roles are filled by some of the prison guards from the levels below. If you go to the bathrooms (which thankfully have showers) while the regulars are working, they’ll just stand there silently until you leave before hatefully cleaning up after you. If you get the guards, then as soon as you exit your cubicle or shower cell you’ll be blasted by water cannons by men and women in hazmat suits. The man tells me off the top of his head what he believes the prison guard shift hours are typically, and on the basis of this knowledge I decide that once I’ve eaten, I’ll shower, then I’ll return to the Airport’s ground level to inspect its academy award-winning forest.<br><br>
                Showered and fed I return to the lift, which now of course feels as if it descends despite my knowledge otherwise. I sleep for much of this journey, far more than I did on my flight here, despite now standing upwards. I’m awoken by the phone conversation of a woman I share the lift with; her son has been lost in this airport for nine years and has just been discovered by one of the higher-ranked secular airport militias, who found him not in the forest as they expected but in a very multicultural smoking room. The boy is eighty years old now and is excited to see his mother. Our journey to ground is nearly done. The ceiling turns on. I didn’t realise it was a screen. It plays adverts for the films and tv series that all planes show, most of which I watched on my flight here: Kevin Costner’s untitled 1997 flopbuster film in which he’s the first homeless man to become president of the United States of America (tagline: from No House, to the White House), We’re Oppressed Too (2017 – 2098) – the reality tv show where the teenage children of trillionaire outer space real estate developers competitively search their ancestries for trauma, The WINEona rydBAR, the interactive wine bar sitcom staring a Winona Ryder bot (among other accomplished bots) which you, as a member of the audience/customer provoke zingers from, I’m Still Talking (2025) – the documentary about Emily Emalay, the eleven year old anarcho-capitalist lifestyle influencer known for promoting anoxeria and foot-binding, Baz Lurhmann’s trap rap musical adaption of Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales starring…we reach ground level.<br><br>
                I follow the signs to the forest. Soon large objects block my way, the first of which is a luxury jeep, the prize of a lottery boasting three trillion tickets sold. Closer by I learn the car was Idi Amin’s and still holds literal skeletons. It has a union jack painted over it like Spice Girls’ paraphernalia. By the car is one of those scale cut-outs of a photo of Amin beside which you can stand and insert your face through an oval chasm negating the face of whoever he stood next to in the original photograph, if tall enough you can insert your own face into the oval chasm for the sake of an unrealistic though still comical portrait of yourself with the smiling Amin. These scale cut-out products seem to have survived the sands of time, and though their popularity peaked between 1974-2006, they’ve been around since the Iron Age and show no sign of disappearing entirely; they seem undefunctable in their low-tech charm. Past Amin’s car is an artwork by Damien Hirst’s great grandnephew. The artwork is called ‘Idi Amin’s Car’ and is a car, but a different brand to Idi Amin’s literal car from before, and the didactic says the work is about the climate crisis, Buddhism and ethical cryptocurrency.<br><br>
                I feel the forest approaching, but first up is the airport’s primary blue-chip fashion district. Migrant workers tend to electrical engineering everywhere which makes sparks fly constantly, a fire hazard surely though no signs are displayed. This is an awful and horrifying place, but no one seems to care. Some fashion brands still display on their store screens adverts staring Lil Gucci Hitler, the seventeen-year-old male model rapper who always evaded ‘cancellation’ due to his difficult childhood and aesthetic defence of claiming that his performing name, as with all his music, was entirely AI-generated. Most advertisers cut ties with him after he joined the Westborough Baptist Church before being killed by a lightning strike/lion attack. Lil Gucci Hitlers are everywhere in this strip. Their kind will die out soon when this culture reverts to another law-binding four years of syrupy sincerity before gagging, and then wallowing for four years of cynical jaded depression once more, and on and off again onwards into eternity.
                The forest at last. Approaching it is reminiscent of the first major factory environment scene in Willy Wonka (1971), the chocolate river scene (many are unaware that the character William Wonka was in fact based off Joseph Stalin, whose deportation of entire national populations for the sake of industrial labour found representation in the Oompa Loompa musical workforce). There are some similar colour hues, but the reminiscence I feel is primarily mood-based, a feeling that at any moment, from within this world of pure hyperbolic consumer joy, misery might arise and fracture the atmosphere like in bad horror films or tv dream sequences where suddenly all goes wrong and evil. The forest invokes the work of the Albert Speer of eco-capitalism, Danish architect Bjarke Ingles and his design ideology of ‘Hedonistic Sustainability’ – accused of glibness (unfairly claims Gwyneth Paltrow, Ron DeSantis and Bashar Al-Assad) for his professional affiliation with fascist-pyromaniac Jair Bolsonaro. Among the forest trees migrant workers with robots tend to the seemingly constant maintenance of an ecology devoid of life beyond their nursing and the endless flow of transit-spectators. I can’t see any insects of any size, not other than the giant mechanical spider that replaces garden lightbulbs. The trees and plants feel fake as I knew they would, to the point that I, as someone of no horticultural knowledge, need to touch them to see whether real trees can in fact look so fake. The presence of wires running up and around organic matter makes this all feel clinical; these are not trees and plants but rather Darth Vader-ish cyborgs which, despite their performance as a symbol of green power and vitality, are biologically hanging by a manmade thread.
                I sit in the forest, surrounding by a panopticon of Parisian cafes selling 50 USD Flat Whites, vintage Lego Stores, ironic assault rifle vendors, VR Yoga studios and a flagship outlet for Beyonce’s drone warfare startup, and as if to bring this whole world crashing down a young man asks me to take a photo of him with his phone, a portrait of him in the forest smiling. I take the photos and he thanks me and shakes my hand. He leaves me with a sense of humanity almost forgotten. A film I watched on the plane here had a scene like this, but it felt so much more fake. It won a non-simulacrum award but still felt hollow compared to what just happened.<br><br>
                I sit and hope to find some trace of life in the plants. Even something like an ant, an animal I’d otherwise consider ‘robotic’ compared to ‘real life’, but which now would feel inspirational, like a single flower growing in a desert or desolate, grey, and waveless beach. I’m not finding anything, but the search feels meaningful. I wonder whether my days of sleeplessness will trigger hallucinatory life; this would be fine, so long as I wasn’t sure; I’d be willing to fall for it.
                I wake from sleep in a sitting position. I’m still here in the forest. My watch says I slept for three seconds. I need the bathrooms now. There are many nearby and they’re all expensive. They’re armed by guards dressed like Colonel Gadhafi, which to me means they look more like Naval officers than anything, but I don’t really know anything about military aesthetics. I can only afford the cheapest of bathrooms, which is just a long urinal – there are no cubicles no sinks no nothing. The smell is extreme and there seem no attempts at mitigation beyond Michael Jackson music. Despite the utter disgustingness of this rancid room of polished tiles I have found what I was looking for; signs of animal life; for the urinal is raging ecosystem of dark brown insects unlike any I’ve ever seen, each the length of my middle finger, none flying around the room, they just crawl and pulsate around the wet stainless steel. A woman’s voice from behind me says,<br><br>
                “You’ve never seen these before, have you?”<br><br>
                “No – are they, indigenous to the region?”<br><br>
                “They’re bred here in the airport somewhere. They crawl through the plumbing. They cause no harm though. They sell them, actually, on the level above, next to the Lego Store. They’re sold in jars. They crawl around in there. It’s not torturous for them; they enjoy physical solitude. All they need is imagination. They’re not even so expensive to buy either. Airport management want rid of them so they sell them cheaply. If you’re transit is long, I’d suggest going up and buying one. They’re good company.”<br><br>
                “Yes, I’ve been, feeling a little alienated here. The nature of travel, I guess. I’ve been wanting some human connection. But one of these in a jar – maybe it’ll do for now.”<br><br>
                “You’ll be surprised by the bond you develop. I’m not just saying so because it’s my job.”<br><br>
                After using the facilities, I make my way upstairs through the forest to buy one of the insects I just pissed on. That woman was right about the prices: one insect in a jar is just four US cents, whereas next door, the cheapest LEGO product – an average LEGO-sized figure of Saddam Hussein – costs five thousand US dollars. I buy an insect in a jar. I can afford two but I decide one’s enough for now. Better to see how I handle one before growing the family.<br><br>
                I return to the forest, to one of its most dense portions, the leafiest of its areas, where one can almost, if trying hard, believe they’re not in an airport. I lie down and look into the jar I just bought. The animal inside does seem content. It’s not a product to me, it is a living thing, and the world of the jar does somehow for it seem limitless. I wonder what would happen if these creatures were introduced to the forest. Upon purchase I was told the punishment for opening the lid of this jar was death – it was illegal to do anything but take the jar with you onto your next flight, then dispose of it in the bins of wherever you land as these creatures are deemed biohazards in almost all states on earth. If I were to let it out here, would I really get caught? And what would happen to this forest if one or two or more of these creatures made it their home? Perhaps a biblical plague would erupt, and maybe no living thing, after a certain amount of time, would see this as anything beyond a necessary fate.<br><br>
                I’m rocked to sleep peacefully by imageries of plague.
